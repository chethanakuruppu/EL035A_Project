XX-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a technique used to study the properties of materials
by measuring the absorption of X-rays as a function of energy. It’s particularly useful for
analyzing the local structure and electronic properties of materials, including alloys.
Analysis of Alloy Structure using X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) with
X-ray Tube and Flat Panel Detector
• X-ray tube with adjustable energy settings.
• Flat panel detector with high spatial resolution.
• Data analysis software for XAS data preprocessing, spectral fitting, and statistical anal-
ysis.
Utilize an X-ray tube as the source of X-rays. The X-ray tube generates X-rays with a range
of energies (<35eV), suitable for exciting the core electrons of the elements present in the alloy
sample. Prepare a representative sample of the alloy of interest. Employ a flat panel detector
positioned opposite to the X-ray tube relative to the alloy sample as shown in the figure (19).
The flat panel detector captures the transmitted X-rays, providing spatially resolved intensity
measurements. Experimental Procedure: Perform calibration of the X-ray tube and flat panel detector
to ensure accurate energy measurements and spatial resolution. Calibrate the energy scale of the
X-ray tube and spatial coordinates of the flat panel detector. Set the energy of the X-ray tube to
scan across the absorption edges of the elements present in the alloy sample. Choose appropriate
energy ranges based on the elements of interest. Record X-ray absorption spectra by measuring
the intensity of transmitted X-rays as a function of energy. Collect spatially resolved spectra
by scanning the alloy sample across the X-ray beam. Acquire XAS data for multiple regions of interest within the alloy sample, covering different phases, grain boundaries, and defect sites.
Summarize findings from the XAS analysis and their significance for understanding the alloy’s
properties. Highlight insights gained from the experiment and propose future directions for
research or applications in alloy design, processing, or characterization.

should include spectra for pure aluminum as well as different alloy compositions. Preprocess
the X-ray absorption spectra data. This may involve normalization, noise reduction, or other
preprocessing techniques to ensure the data is suitable for training the DNN model. Design the
architecture of the DNN model. This typically involves deciding on the number of layers, types
of layers (e.g., convolutional layers, dense layers), and activation functions. Train the DNN
model using the preprocessed X-ray absorption spectra data. During training, the model learns
to map input spectra to output labels (e.g., alloy composition). Train the DNN model using
